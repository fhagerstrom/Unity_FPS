# Unity_FPS
An FPS game that I'm working on in Unity. This will lean into the same style as Goldeneye / Perfect Dark that was developed by Rareware and released on the Nintendo 64.

Purely a hobby project which I'm working on when there's time over from studying or working, which will be a fun challenge. 
I submitted this project on Day9's DK30 projects, which is a "challenge" where people commit to a project, work on it for 30 days (and beyond), and share their progress with others.
